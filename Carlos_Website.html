     <h4>About Me</h4>
     <p> I am Carlos Hernandez, an aspiring coder that wishes to works in the fields of robotics in Japan. 
        I am a recent graduate of Information Science from the University of South Florida. This website, therefore, is a modefied repository of 
        my achievements. </p>

     <h4>Cryptocurrency Paper</h4>
     <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn my last semester at USF, I was tasked with researching two topics that concerned the field of Information Science. 
         I choose the strengths of Cryptocurrencies and the role of A. I in education as my topics of research due to my interests in these. 
         These interests stem from my desire to be part of the upcoming A. I revolution, and the creation of humanoid artificial intelligence. 
         The papers and their respective presentations will be presented below:</p>

     <h4>Unbound</h4>
     <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspUnbound is an alpha version of a game concept created by Eduardo Dotel (a friend of mine) and this website creator. 
         The game will take place in 18th century Cuba and would see a soldier fighting a werewolf clan, coinciding with the invasion of the country by the English in 1741.  
         The game is conceptualized to follow the trends created by game giants such as Doom( 1993 and 2016), Wolfenstein, Blood, etc. 
         To accomplish this vision, we used free assets to create the game's code from scratch. 
         The creation of the game has been put on hiatus for financial reasons; however, some of the progress will be shown below:</p>
